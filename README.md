To sign, **click [here](https://github.com/rms-support-letter/rms-support-letter.github.io/new/master/_data/signed)** and name the file `<username>.yaml` (replace `<username>` with your name) with the following content:

```yaml
name: <your name here (optional organization or company)>
link: <link to your profile or site>
```

Without the `<>`.

Example:
```yaml
name: Example name (Good company)
link: https://github.com/example_username
```

Don't use `<>` in this file, as well as non-ascii symbols in file name. If you're using your email as a link, prepend it with `mailto:`. If you are able to, please use your real name and add projects and affiliated organizations in parentheses.

Then **click "Propose new file"** and go through the subsequent pages to create a merge request.

If you can, please consider sharing this letter on your forums and social media and notify journalists who might be helpful to our cause.

Alternatively, fork and clone the repo, create the file `_data/signed/<username>.yaml` manually, then commit and submit a PR.

If you want to support the letter **without using Github**, go here: https://codeberg.org/rms-support-letter/rms-support-letter/issues/1, or send a signed patch to [signrms@prog.cf](mailto:signrms@prog.cf) or [~tyil/rms-support@lists.sr.ht](mailto:~tyil/rms-support@lists.sr.ht).
